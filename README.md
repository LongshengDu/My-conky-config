# My-conky-config
My Conky configuration file

Default_color let's you change the color.
<br>
If you want to change the position of your conky window, you can do that at "gap_x" and "gap_y". 
<br>
minimum_size and maximum_width can change the size of your conky window. 
<br>
Change the CPU parameters to your needs; e.g. if you have just two cores, remove CPU2 and CPU3. 
<br>
Finally remember to change wlan0 to your network interface. Probably eth0, if wlan0 doesn't work.
